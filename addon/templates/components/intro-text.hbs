page and wait for the results to appear or come back later. If you come back later and the rule is finished, you can find it in the timestamp list. <br> If a rule already ran before, you will see a list of timestamps you can choose from to download
the previous results. <br> If you just started running a rule, it will appear in this list when the execution finished.
